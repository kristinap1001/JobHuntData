This project is a Sankey diagram generated from my job search data 2023-present. The Python script pulls my spreadsheet data directly from Google Sheets using gspread, then transforms the data into the proper format for Plotly's Sankey diagram using Pandas and NumPy, before finally using Plotly to generate the diagram and export it into an interactive HTML file which can be seen [here](https://kristinap1001.github.io/jobhuntdata/sankeydiagram.html).
